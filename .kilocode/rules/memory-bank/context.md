# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

**Memory Bank Initialization**: Comprehensive analysis and documentation of the Konsulin backend service architecture, technologies, and implementation patterns.

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation (2025-09-17)
- **Created**: Complete memory bank structure with product.md, architecture.md, and tech.md
- **Analysis**: Exhaustive examination of Go backend codebase
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive system architecture and technology stack documentation

### Key Findings from Analysis
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with API Gateway design
- **Primary Technology**: Go 1.22.3 with Chi router
- **Authentication**: SuperTokens with magic link authentication
- **Authorization**: Casbin RBAC with fine-grained permissions
- **FHIR Integration**: Blaze server proxied through backend with role-based filtering
- **Payment Gateway**: OY! Indonesia integration for service-based pricing
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Coolify deployment automation

## Current System State

### Core Services Status
- **API Gateway**: Fully implemented with middleware chain
- **FHIR Proxy**: Complete with response filtering and ownership validation
- **Authentication**: SuperTokens integration with Redis session management
- **Authorization**: Casbin RBAC with 6 roles (Guest, Patient, Practitioner, Clinic Admin, Researcher, Superadmin)
- **Payment Processing**: OY! Indonesia integration for 4 services (analyze, report, performance-report, access-dataset)

### Key Implementation Patterns
- **Middleware Chain**: Request ID → Logging → Body Buffer → CORS → SuperTokens → API Key → Session → Rate Limit → Error Handler
- **RBAC Enforcement**: Method + Path based permissions with resource ownership validation
- **Proxy Pattern**: FHIR requests proxied with compression handling and response filtering
- **Clean Architecture**: Delivery → Services → Repositories → External layers

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
- Complete memory bank validation with user
- Ensure all critical system aspects are documented
- Verify memory bank completeness and accuracy

### Potential Areas for Enhancement
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Additional integration testing coverage
- Documentation of deployment procedures

## Technical Debt and Considerations

### Current Limitations
- MongoDB driver included but not actively used (legacy dependency)
- Some PostgreSQL references in codebase, which will be deprecated
- Rate limiting implementation could benefit from distributed coordination

### Architecture Strengths
- Well-structured Clean Architecture implementation
- Comprehensive RBAC system with fine-grained permissions
- Robust FHIR integration with proper filtering
- Secure authentication and session management
- Effective API gateway pattern implementation

## Development Environment

### Local Setup
- Docker Compose stack with Redis, Blaze FHIR server, and SuperTokens
- Environment-based configuration with Viper
- Structured logging with Zap
- Comprehensive middleware chain for request processing

### Production Deployment
- Containerized deployment via Coolify
- Domain: api.konsulin.care
- SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Structured logging with rotation
- Health checks and monitoring
